# Personal Portfolio

Deadline - Dec 5, 2022

## Description

Given a Gif of an example web page containing a developer's portfolio as a reference, I was tasked with building my own portfolio page that can be added to throughout the course. The idea was to use skills learned up to this point including media queries, CSS variables, and flexbox. The given user story was: 

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

The acceptance criteria were:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

The portfolio includes an About Me section as well as a section with links to my deployed projects. At this time I only have one deployed project but I included two more "coming soon" project links to show that the format of the My Work section would meet the acceptance criteria. The paragraph in the About Me section is from the Lorem Ipsem Generator. As I progress in my work I will add real info about me.
