# Horiseon Mainpage Refactoring
Deadline - Nov 28, 2022

## Description

Given starter code my assignment was to refactor the code to meet accessiblity standards and best practices for semantic HTML as well as consolidate and organize CSS selectors and properties. The resulting code should optimize the site for search engines.

The HTML portion of the code was refactored using semantic HTML elements and the CSS portion was condensed using references to the semantic HTML. Comments were added to the CSS AND HTML. The comments in the
HTML were written using the format found in the GitHub Styleguide. The elements that were given were mostly &lt;div&gt;. Those were almost entirely changed to semantic HTML that represented the place and function of the code. The new tags were then checked for format against the GitHub style guide for HTML. The CSS follows the best practices that I found on multiple tutorial websites. The CSS comments had slightly fewer rules than the HTML comments so I styled them to look similar to the HTML comments for continuity and readability. All of the images on the page are purely decorative and as such have no information in the image alt attributes. If I had added text to the alt tags it would have been confusing for screen readers and led to poor accessibility. If the images do no load for some reason, the information held in their articles will not be affected.

The webpage is made up of a header, and main portion that includes three articles, an aside that includes three articles, and a footer. The header is relatively simple, with the company name/logo on the left and a navigation bar on the right side. The navigation bar consists of three links that take the user to their respective articles in the main portion. The large image associated with the header also contains no pertinant visual information so its alt tag includes no information. The main portion is composed of three articles. Each article briefly describes a service that Horiseon provides. Each article includes a small image that helps break up the text but does not provide any pertinant information to the reader; as such their alt tags are present but include no descriptions. The aside is placed on the right side of the page. It includes three articles that each briefly describe a benefit of using Horiseon's services. Each article includes a small image that helps break up the text but does not add any pertinant visual information; as such their alt tags are included but contain no description. The footer contains copyright information as well as the company name. 


## Site Preview

## Usage

The website is based on a real company website but will not provide the user access to a real company. The links on the page should take the user to the referenced section of the page.
